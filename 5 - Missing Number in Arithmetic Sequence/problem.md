# Array: Find Missing Number in Arithmetic Sequence
Given an array that represents an arithmetic progression with one missing element, implement a function to find the missing number. An arithmetic progression is defined as a sequence of numbers such that the difference of any two successive members is a constant. Consider the input array is non-empty and the progression has at least three elements (including the missing one).

Example:

```js 
Input: [5, 10, 20, 25, 30]
Output: 15
```
