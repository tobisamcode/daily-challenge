# Check if Number is a Happy Number

Implement a function to determine if a number is a happy number. A happy number is defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers.

Example:

```js
Input: 19;
Output: true;
```
