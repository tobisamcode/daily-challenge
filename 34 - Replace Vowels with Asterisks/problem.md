# Replace Vowels with Asterisks

Write a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string with all vowels (a, e, i, o, u) replaced by asterisks (_). This function should be case-insensitive, meaning 'A' and 'a' are both considered vowels and should be replaced by '_'.

Example:

```js
Input: "hello World";
Output: "h*ll* W*rld";
```
