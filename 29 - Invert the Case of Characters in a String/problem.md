# Invert the Case of Characters in a String

Create a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string where each uppercase letter is replaced with its lowercase equivalent and each lowercase letter is replaced with its uppercase equivalent. Non-alphabetical characters should remain unchanged.

Example:

```js
Input: "Hello, World!";
Output: "hELLO, wORLD!";
```
