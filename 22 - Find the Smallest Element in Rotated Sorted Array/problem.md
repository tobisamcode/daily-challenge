# Find the Smallest Element in Rotated Sorted Array

You're given a rotated sorted array, where the original array was sorted in increasing order, but then it was rotated at some pivot. Your task is to find the smallest element in the rotated array. Assume there are no duplicate elements in the array.

Example:

```js
Input: [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2];
Output: 0;
```
