# String Compression
Implement a string compression function that uses the counts of repeated characters. For character sequence, if the character is repeated, it should be compressed into the format `character+count`. For example, the string "aabcccccaaa" should become "a2b1c5a3". If the compressed string is not smaller than the original, return the original string.

Example:
```js
Input: "aabcccccaaa"
Output: "a2b1c5a3"
```
