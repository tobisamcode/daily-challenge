# Frequency of Numbers in a Matrix

Write a function that receives a matrix of integers and returns an object representing the frequency of each number present in the matrix. The matrix can vary in dimensions (n x m), and the numbers can be both positive and negative.

Example:

```js
Input: [[1, 2, 2, 3], [3, 3, 1], [4, 5, 1, 1]]
Output: {"1": 4, "2": 2, "3": 3, "4": 1, "5": 1}
```
