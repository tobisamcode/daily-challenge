## 👀 Visualization of the Loops

### 🧩 Input:

```js
nums = [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18];
```

### 🔁 Outer Loop (i): Goes from `1` to `n - 1`

For each `i`, inner loop `j` checks all elements before `i`

---

### 🧠 DP Table Before Start:

```
dp = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
```

---

### 🔄 Loop-by-loop breakdown:

| `i` | `nums[i]` | `j` values checked               | `nums[j] < nums[i]`?               | `dp[i]` updated?     | `dp[]` at end of i       |
| --- | --------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1   | 9         | j = 0 → 10                       | ❌                                 | No                   | [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] |
| 2   | 2         | j = 0 → 10, j = 1 → 9            | ❌ ❌                              | No                   | [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] |
| 3   | 5         | j = 0 → 10, j = 1 → 9, j = 2 → 2 | ✅ (2 < 5) → `dp[3] = 2`           | Yes                  | [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1] |
| 4   | 3         | j = 0–3 (10, 9, 2, 5)            | ✅ (2 < 3)                         | `dp[4] = 2`          | [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1] |
| 5   | 7         | j = 0–4                          | ✅ (2 < 7), ✅ (3 < 7), ✅ (5 < 7) | `dp[5] = 3` (from 5) | [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1] |
| 6   | 101       | j = 0–5                          | ✅ many times                      | `dp[6] = 4` (from 7) | [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 1] |
| 7   | 18        | j = 0–6                          | ✅ up to 7                         | `dp[7] = 4` (from 7) | [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4] |

### ✅ Final DP Array:

```
[1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]
```

- The **maximum** value in the array is `4`, which is the answer.

### 🔍 Summary of Visual Loops:

- The **outer loop (`i`)** represents each number as the "current ending point" of a subsequence.
- The **inner loop (`j`)** looks **before `i`** to find any **smaller number** and **extend** the sequence.
- The `dp[i]` gets updated only if we find a **valid increasing pattern**.
- The **max of `dp[]`** tells us the length of the longest subsequence we can build.
