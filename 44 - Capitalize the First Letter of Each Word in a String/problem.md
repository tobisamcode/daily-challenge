# Capitalize the First Letter of Each Word in a String

Given a sentence, your task is to capitalize the first letter of each word. Words are separated by spaces, and no punctuation needs to be considered. Return the resulting string with each word capitalized.

Example:

```js
Input: "hello world";
Output: "Hello World";
```
