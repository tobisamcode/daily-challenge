# Sort Array by Parity

Write a function that takes an array of non-negative integers and returns a new array where all the even numbers are followed by all the odd numbers. The order of even numbers and odd numbers in the original array should be preserved in the output array.

Example:

```js
Input: [3, 1, 2, 4];
Output: [2, 4, 3, 1];
```
