# Find Majority Element in an Array
Given an array of integers, your task is to find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times in the array, where n is the length of the array. You can assume that the array always has a majority element.

Example:
```js
Input: [3, 2, 3]
Output: 3
```
