# Shuffle Array Elements in Pairs
Given an array of even length, shuffle its elements such that the first element is swapped with the second, the third with the fourth, and so on. The task is to rearrange the array in-place in these pairs.

Example:
```js
Input: [5, 9, 1, 3, 8, 2]
Output: [9, 5, 3, 1, 2, 8]
```
