# Determine Unique Elements in a Series

Write a JavaScript function that takes in an array of strings and returns a new array containing only the unique strings. The order of unique strings should be the same as in the original array. Strings are case-sensitive.

Example:

```js
Input: ["apple", "banana", "apple", "orange", "banana", "kiwi"];
Output: ["apple", "banana", "orange", "kiwi"];
```
