# Convert Snake Case to Camel Case

Write a function that converts a given string in snake*case format to camelCase format. Snake case strings are those where words are separated by underscores ( * ). In camelCase, words are joined together and each word after the first word starts with an uppercase letter, and no underscores should be present.

Example:

```js
Input: "this_is_a_test_string";
Output: "thisIsATestString";
```
