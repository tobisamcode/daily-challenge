# Transform Array by Multiplying Even Indices and Subtracting Odd Indices

Create a function that takes an array of integers and transforms it according to specific rules: multiply the elements at even indices by their index number, and subtract the index number from elements at odd indices.

Example:
```js
Input: [4, 3, 6, 2, 5]
Output: [0, 2, 12, -1, 20]
```
