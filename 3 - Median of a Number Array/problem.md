# Calculate Median of a Number Array

Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the median value. The median is the middle number in a sorted list of numbers. If the list is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.

Example:
```js
Input: [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]
Output: 3.5
