# Merge Overlapping Time Intervals

Given a list of time intervals represented as pairs of start and end times, merge all overlapping intervals and return a list of the merged intervals. Each interval is a pair of integers [start, end], where start is less than end.

Example:

````js
Input: [[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
Output: [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]```
