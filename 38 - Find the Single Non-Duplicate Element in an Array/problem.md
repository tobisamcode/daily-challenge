# Find the Single Non-Duplicate Element in an Array

Given a sorted array where every element appears twice except for one element which appears only once, find the single element that appears only once. Your solution should have a linear runtime complexity and you cannot use extra space (modify in-place if required).

Example:

```js
Input: [1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 7, 7];
Output: 5;
```
