# Generate All Possible IP Addresses

Given a string consisting of only digits, write a function to restore it by returning all possible valid IP address combinations. IP addresses consist of four octets separated by decimal points, and each octet must be between 0 and 255 inclusive. Leading zeros are not allowed except for the number itself zero.

Example:

```js
Input: "25525511135";
Output: ["255.255.11.135", "255.255.111.35"];
```
