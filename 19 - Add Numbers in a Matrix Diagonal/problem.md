# Add Numbers in a Matrix Diagonal

Create a function that takes a square matrix (2D array) as input and returns the sum of the numbers in the matrix's main diagonal. The main diagonal of a matrix consists of the elements starting from the top left corner to the bottom right corner.

Example:

```js
Input: [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9],
];
Output: 15;
```
