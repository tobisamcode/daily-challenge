# Reverse Words in a String

Given a string, reverse the order of words in the string. A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in the input string will be separated by at least one space. You need to return a string that joins the words with a single space in the reversed order. Ensure to trim any leading or trailing spaces from the input before processing.

Example:

```js
Input: " Hello World! Welcome to JavaScript Challenges ";
Output: "Challenges JavaScript to Welcome World! Hello";
```
